The Rise of Athens

Athens, often hailed as the birthplace of democracy, was a remarkable city state that flourished during the Golden Age of Greece. The Athenian democracy was established in the 5th century BCE, making it one of the earliest known democratic systems in the world. The democratic reforms were initiated by Solon in the 6th century BCE, but it was Pericles who truly solidified the democratic principles and led Athens to its pinnacle of power and influence.

Under Pericles' leadership, Athens experienced a period of great prosperity, artistic achievements, and intellectual advancements. Known as the Periclean Age, this period saw the construction of magnificent architectural wonders such as the Parthenon, which still stands as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece. Athens became an epicenter of knowledge, attracting philosophers, writers, and artists from all over the Mediterranean.

The Athenian democracy was characterized by direct participation of citizens in the decision
making process. All male citizens above the age of 18 had the right to vote and participate in the Assembly, where important decisions regarding legislation and foreign policy were made. However, it is essential to note that not all individuals were considered citizens; women, slaves, and foreigners were excluded from political participation.
