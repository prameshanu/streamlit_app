Democracy in Athens


At the heart of Athens' legacy lies its pioneering experiment with democracy. Unlike any other city
state at the time, Athens established a system of government that allowed its citizens to participate directly in decision making. This radical concept, known as "demokratia," laid the foundation for modern democratic principles.

The birth of Athenian democracy can be traced back to the reforms of Cleisthenes in the late 6th century BCE. Cleisthenes introduced the idea of equal participation for all eligible citizens, regardless of their social status. This marked a significant departure from the traditional oligarchic rule prevalent in ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, citizens had the right to vote, speak freely in public assemblies, and even hold public office.

One of the most important institutions of Athenian democracy was the Assembly, known as the Ecclesia. All male citizens over the age of 18 were eligible to attend the Assembly, where they could debate and vote on various issues, including legislation, foreign policy, and the appointment of officials. This inclusive system gave every citizen a voice, ensuring that power was not concentrated in the hands of a few privileged individuals.

Another significant aspect of Athenian democracy was the use of sortition, a process of selecting public officials by lot rather than through elections. This practice aimed to prevent corruption and the influence of wealth in politics. It also allowed for a more diverse representation of citizens, ensuring that anyone could hold public office.
