Major Events and Strategies

The Peloponnesian War can be divided into three distinct phases. The first phase, known as the Archidamian War, lasted from 431 to 421 BCE. It began with a Spartan invasion of Attica, the region surrounding Athens, aiming to weaken the Athenian economy and morale. However, Athenians, guided by Pericles' strategy of relying on their powerful navy and the safety of their fortified city walls, endured the Spartan invasion. The war in this phase largely revolved around skirmishes, sieges, and occasional battles.

The second phase, the Sicilian Expedition, took place from 415 to 413 BCE. Athens, seeking to expand its influence and weaken Sparta, launched an ambitious campaign to conquer Syracuse, a powerful city
state in Sicily. However, this expedition turned into a disaster for Athens as their large fleet and army were ultimately defeated, leading to a significant loss of resources and a decline in Athenian power.

The third phase, known as the Ionian War, lasted from 413 to 404 BCE. In this phase, Sparta, with the support of Persia, launched a series of successful campaigns against Athens and its remaining allies. Athens faced several naval defeats, most notably the Battle of Aegospotami, where the Spartan fleet, under Lysander, decisively defeated the Athenian navy, effectively cutting off Athens from its vital grain supply routes. This victory led to the final siege of Athens, resulting in its surrender in 404 BCE.

Throughout the war, both Athens and Sparta employed different strategies. Athens relied on its navy, using its superior fleet to control the sea and access resources from its overseas empire. This strategy aimed to wear down the Spartans over time, as they were primarily a land
based power. Sparta, on the other hand, focused on its formidable army and aimed to weaken Athens by ravaging its countryside and devastating its economy.
