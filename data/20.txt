Social Structure and Upbringing

Sparta's social structure was unlike any other in ancient Greece. It was strictly divided into three classes: the Spartiates, the Perioikoi, and the Helots. At the top of the hierarchy were the Spartiates, who were full citizens and served as the backbone of the Spartan military. They were descendants of the original Dorian conquerors and were required to undergo rigorous military training from a young age.

The upbringing of Spartan males was centered around physical and military education. At the age of seven, Spartan boys were taken from their families and enrolled in the agoge, a state
run educational system. Here, they were taught discipline, endurance, and the art of warfare. They were subjected to a harsh regime that included physical training, harsh living conditions, and constant testing of their mental and physical abilities. This rigorous training aimed to produce capable and fearless warriors.

The Spartan way of life emphasized selflessness and obedience to the state. Boys were encouraged to develop strong bonds among themselves, forming tight knit units known as syssitia. These units fostered camaraderie and loyalty, essential qualities in battle. Spartan girls also received physical education to ensure they bore strong and healthy offspring for the Spartan state. This focus on physical training and discipline played a significant role in shaping the warrior society of Sparta.
