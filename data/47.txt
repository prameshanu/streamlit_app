The Twelve Olympians

At the pinnacle of the Greek pantheon stands the Twelve Olympians, the most significant gods and goddesses who reside on Mount Olympus. Zeus, the king of gods, rules over this majestic assembly, wielding his thunderbolts and enforcing justice. Hera, his sister and wife, is the queen of the gods and the protector of marriage and childbirth. Poseidon, god of the sea, commands the waves and earthquakes, while his brother Hades rules the underworld, guiding souls to their eternal resting place.

The remaining members of the Twelve Olympians play vital roles in Greek mythology. Athena, the goddess of wisdom and warfare, is renowned for her strategic brilliance. Apollo, the god of music, poetry, and prophecy, is also associated with healing and the sun. Artemis, Apollo's twin sister, governs the moon and is the goddess of the hunt. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, possesses incredible speed and cunning. Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, captivates both mortals and immortals alike.
