The Great Persian Invasion

Following Darius I's death in 486 BCE, his son Xerxes I ascended the Persian throne and inherited his father's ambition to conquer Greece. Xerxes, fueled by a desire for revenge and to assert Persia's dominance, assembled an enormous army and fleet to launch a second invasion of Greece.

In 480 BCE, the Persian forces, consisting of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, embarked on a perilous journey across the Hellespont, a narrow strait separating Asia from Europe. Xerxes' army moved through Thrace and Macedonia, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The Persian navy, accompanying the land forces, sailed parallel to their advance.

The Greek city
states, aware of the impending threat, put aside their differences and formed an alliance known as the Hellenic League. Led by Athens and Sparta, the Greeks sought to defend their homeland against the Persian invaders. The Hellenic League devised a strategy to block the Persian advance at the narrow pass of Thermopylae and engage the Persian navy at the strait of Artemisium.

At the Battle of Thermopylae, a small force of Greek soldiers, including the famous Spartan warriors, held off the much larger Persian army for several days. However, a traitor revealed a mountain path that allowed the Persians to flank the Greek position, leading to their defeat. Despite this setback, the Greek resistance had bought valuable time.

Simultaneously, the Greek navy engaged the Persian fleet at the Battle of Artemisium. Although the Greeks suffered heavy losses, they managed to inflict significant damage on the Persian navy, preventing them from achieving total control over the sea.
