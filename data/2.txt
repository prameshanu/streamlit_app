The Collapse and Dark Age

Around 1200 BCE, the Mycenaean civilization faced a sudden and catastrophic collapse. The reasons for this decline remain a subject of debate among historians, with theories ranging from natural disasters to internal strife and external invasions. Whatever the cause, the fall of the Mycenaeans plunged the Aegean region into a period of darkness and decline.

This era, known as the Dark Age, lasted approximately four centuries. It was characterized by a decline in population, the abandonment of cities, and the loss of writing and literacy. The once
thriving trade networks disintegrated, and Greece entered a period of isolation.

During this time, the Greeks experienced significant cultural and societal changes. The population shifted from urban centers to rural settlements, leading to the rise of independent farming communities. The economy became more self sufficient, relying on agriculture and local trade.

Despite the challenges of the Dark Age, it is during this period that the seeds of the Greek Renaissance were planted. The isolated communities began to develop their unique cultural identities, which would later become the foundation of Ancient Greece. It was also during this time that the oral tradition of storytelling thrived, passing down myths, legends, and historical accounts from one generation to the next.
